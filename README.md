## Setup and Run

1. Clone and enter the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/satyambnsal/noirlings.git
cd noirlings
```

Make sure you have both Rust and Noir installed. If you don't have it installed:
Run
 ```
 ./install.sh
 ``` 

**If you see any error in terminal, install them separately with following commands**
1. Install Rust and Cargo:

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s
```
2. Install Noir:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noir-lang/noirup/refs/heads/main/install | bash
noirup
```

3. After Installing **Rust** and **Nargo**, you are ready to run your exercises. Lets first install the project binary with
```
cargo install --path .
```

4. Now you should have noirlings available as command. You can verify the installation with
```
noirlings --version
```


## Start Exercises ðŸ’»

```sh
noirlings watch 
```



## How Noirlings Works

Noirlings is designed to help you learn Noir through hands-on exercises:

1. Each exercise is a Noir file containing a problem to solve
2. Run `noirlings watch` to start - you'll see an error message for the first exercise
3. Open the exercise file in your editor and start solving
4. Type `hint` in watch mode for help, or run `noirlings hint exercise_name`
5. Remove the `// I AM NOT DONE` comment when you've solved an exercise
6. Watch mode automatically verifies your solution and moves to the next exercise

## VSCode Support

For syntax highlighting and language support:

1. Install the [Noir VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=noir-lang.vscode-noir)
2. Open the project folder in VSCode

## Contributing

### Adding New Exercises

1. Create exercise file in `./exercises/<module_name>/<exercise_name>.nr`
2. Add exercise metadata to `info.toml`:

```toml
[[exercises]]
name = "exercise_name"
path = "exercises/module/exercise_name.nr"
mode = "test"
hint = "Your helpful hint here"
```

3. Test your exercise:

```sh
noirlings run exercise_name
```

4. Run test suite
5. Submit a PR!

### Testing

Run specific tests:

```sh
cargo test noir
```

Run all tests:

```sh
cargo test
```
